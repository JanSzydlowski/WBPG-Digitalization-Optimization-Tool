Tool created on my internship to help optimize work in the digitalization department of provincial public library in Gdansk. It uses Tesseract and multiple cores to convert TIFF files in the current folder to compressed OCR'ed PDF and also create JPEG copies of TIFF files. 
All console outputs are in Polish for ease of use for librarians using software.
